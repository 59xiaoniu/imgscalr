/**
 * Class used to provide the asynchronous versions of all the methods defined in
 * {@link Scalr} for the purpose of efficiently handling large amounts of image
 * operations via a select number of processing threads.
 * <p/>
 * Given that image-scaling operations, especially when working with large
 * images, can be very hardware-intensive (both CPU and memory), in large-scale
 * deployments (e.g. a busy web application) it becomes increasingly important
 * that the scale operations performed by imgscalr be manageable so as not to
 * fire off too many simultaneous operations that the JVM's heap explodes and
 * runs out of memory or pegs the CPU on the host machine, staving all other
 * running processes.
 * <p/>
 * Up until now it was left to the caller to implement their own serialization
 * or limiting logic to handle these use-cases. Given imgscalr's popularity in
 * web applications it was determined that this requirement be common enough
 * that it should be integrated directly into the imgscalr library for everyone
 * to benefit from.
 * <p/>
 * Every method in this class wraps the mirrored calls in the {@link Scalr}
 * class in new {@link Callable} instances that are submitted to an internal
 * {@link ExecutorService} for execution at a later date. A {@link Future} is
 * returned to the caller representing the task that will perform the scale
 * operation. {@link Future#get()} or {@link Future#get(long, TimeUnit)} can be
 * used to block on the returned <code>Future</code>, waiting for the scale
 * operation to complete and return the resultant {@link BufferedImage} to the
 * caller.
 * <p/>
 * This design provides the following features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Non-blocking, asynchronous scale operations that can continue execution
 * while waiting on the scaled result.</li>
 * <li>Serialize all scale requests down into a maximum number of
 * <em>simultaneous</em> scale operations with no additional/complex logic. The
 * number of simultaneous scale operations is caller-configurable so as best to
 * optimize the host system (e.g. 1 scale thread per core).</li>
 * <li>No need to worry about overloading the host system with too many scale
 * operations, they will simply queue up in this class and execute in-order.</li>
 * <li>Synchronous/blocking behavior can still be achieved (if desired) by
 * calling <code>get()</code> or <code>get(long, TimeUnit)</code> immediately on
 * the returned {@link Future} from any of the methods below.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h3>Performance</h3>
 * When tuning this class for optimal performance, benchmarking your particular
 * hardware is the best approach. For some rough guidelines though, there are
 * two resources you want to watch closely:
 * <ol>
 * <li>JVM Heap Memory (Assume physical machine memory is always sufficiently
 * large)</li>
 * <li># of CPU Cores</li>
 * </ol>
 * You never want to allocate more scaling threads than you have CPU cores and
 * on a sufficiently busy host where some of the cores may be busy running a
 * database or a web server, you will want to allocate even less scaling
 * threads.
 * <p/>
 * So as a maximum you would never want more scaling threads than CPU cores in
 * any situation and less so on a busy server.
 * <p/>
 * If you allocate more threads than you have available CPU cores, your scaling
 * operations will slow down as the CPU will spend a considerable amount of time
 * context-switching between threads on the same core trying to finish all the
 * tasks in parallel. You might still be tempted to do this because of the I/O
 * delay some threads will encounter reading images off disk, but when you do
 * your own benchmarking you'll likely find (as I did) that the actual disk I/O
 * necessary to pull the image data off disk is a much smaller portion of the
 * execution time than the actual scaling operations.
 * <p/>
 * If you are executing on a storage medium that is unexpectedly slow and I/O is
 * a considerable portion of the scaling operation (e.g. S3 or EBS volumes),
 * feel free to try using more threads than CPU cores to see if that helps; but
 * in most normal cases, it will only slow down all other parallel scaling
 * operations.
 * <p/>
 * As for memory, every time an image is scaled it is decoded into a
 * {@link BufferedImage} and stored in the JVM Heap space (decoded image
 * instances are always larger than the source images on-disk). For larger
 * images, that can use up quite a bit of memory. You will need to benchmark
 * your particular use-cases on your hardware to get an idea of where the sweet
 * spot is for this; if you are operating within tight memory bounds, you may
 * want to limit simultaneous scaling operations to 1 or 2 regardless of the
 * number of cores just to avoid having too many {@link BufferedImage} instances
 * in JVM Heap space at the same time.
 * <p/>
 * These are rough metrics and behaviors to give you an idea of how best to tune
 * this class for your deployment, but nothing can replacement writing a small
 * Java class that scales a handful of images in a number of different ways and
 * testing that directly on your deployment hardware.
 * <h3>Resource Overhead</h3>
 * The {@link ExecutorService} utilized by this class won't be initialized until
 * one of the operation methods are called, at which point the
 * <code>service</code> will be instantiated for the first time and operation
 * queued up.
 * <p/>
 * More specifically, if you have no need for asynchronous image processing
 * offered by this class, you don't need to worry about wasted resources or
 * hanging/idle threads as they will never be created if you never use this
 * class.
 * <h3>Cleaning up Service Threads</h3>
 * By default the {@link Thread}s created by the internal
 * {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} do not run in <code>daemon</code> mode; which
 * means they will block the host VM from exiting until they are explicitly shut
 * down.
 * <p/>
 * If you have used the {@link AsyncScalr} class and are trying to shut down a
 * client application, you will need to call {@link #getService()} then
 * {@link ExecutorService#shutdown()} or <code>shutdownNow()</code> to have the
 * threads terminated.
 * <p/>
 * Alternatively if you are deploying imgscalr and using the async functionality
 * in a client application and this seems like a pain, you can subclass this
 * class and provide a {@link ExecutorService} that uses a {@link ThreadFactory}
 * that creates {@link Thread}s who do run in <code>daemon</code> mode and they
 * will shut themselves down immediately (killing any in-progress work) when the
 * JVM exits.
 * <h3>Custom ExecutorService Implementations</h3>
 * By default this class uses a {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} to handle execution
 * of queued image operations. If a different {@link ExecutorService}
 * implementation is desired, this class can be easily subclasses and the
 * internal {@link #verifyService()} method overridden with custom logic to
 * verify (and if necessary) create a new executor that is assigned to the
 * internal variable <code>service</code>.

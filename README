imgscalr - Java Image-Scaling Library
http://www.thebuzzmedia.com/software/imgscalr-java-image-scaling-library/


Description
-----------
A class implementing performant, good-looking and intelligent image-scaling algorithms
in pure Java. This class implements the Java2D "best practices" when it comes to
scaling images as well as Chris Campbell's incremental scaling algorithm proposed
as the best method for down-sizes images for use as thumbnails (along with some
additional minor optimizations).

TIP: All resizing operations maintain the original images proportions.

This class attempts to make scaling images in Java as simple as possible by providing
a handful of approaches tuned for scaling as fast as possible or as best-looking 
as possible and the ability to let the algorithm choose for you to optionally create 
the best-looking scaled image as fast as possible without boring you with the details 
if you don't want them.


Example
-------
In the simplest use-case where an image needs to be scaled to proportionally fit 
a specific width (say 150px for a thumbnail) and the class is left to decide which 
method will look the best, the code would look like this:

<pre>
BufferedImage srcImage = ImageIO.read(...); // Load image
BufferedImage scaledImage = Scalr.resize(srcImage, 150); // Scale image
</pre>

You could even flatten that out further if you simply wanted to scale the image 
and write out the scaled result immediately to a single line:

<pre>
ImageIO.write(Scalr.resize(ImageIO.read(...), 150));
</pre>


Troubleshooting
---------------
Image-manipulation in Java can take more memory than the size of the source image
because the image has to be "decoded" into raw ARGB bytes when loaded into the
BufferedImage instance; fortunately on most platforms this is a hardware-accelerated
operation by the video card.

If you are running into OutOfMemoryExceptions when using this library (e.g. if you
dealing with multiple-megabyte source images from a high-MP DSLR) try and up the 
heap size using the "-Xmx" command line argument to your Java process.

An example of how to do this looks like:

<pre>
java -Xmx256m com.site.MyApp
</pre>
